## Project Intro

I was provided with the visual assets and in-game loop engine. 
I've created interactive objcts in the game: player and enemy instances. 

## Frogger Game Description

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

Level: increases each time the player reaches the water, it resets to 0 when collision occurs.


## Reflections: 
- JavaScript enables the development of complex applications on the web.
- JavaScript runs on normal web browsers, which makes it one of the most accessible and flexible programming languages.
- Complex applications that must be “broken down” into simpler entities that manage their own properties and functionality.
